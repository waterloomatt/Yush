Yush
====
YUSH (Yii Upload Structure Helper) helps you to maintain resource paths and URLs. It is commonly used by controllers to generate automatic resource paths and by views to retrieve the resource. Please note, YUSH does not perform any uploading functionality. It is used by your application to manage the paths and urls of uploaded resources.
